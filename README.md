# php-backups-viewer

This is the first project I ever built and while it's not pretty, it definitely does the job it is intended for. Because I built it while figuring out PHP at the same time, It is a little chaotic.

If I was to do it again, I would be encapsulating everything inside classes, and separate out view and control logic.
